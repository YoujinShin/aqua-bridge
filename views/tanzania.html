<h2>
Kiwalani community in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, is an urban informal settlement. Water quantity is sufficient but most of the water sources are severely contaminated. We visited the community three times during the past three years and distributed 15 filters in collaboration with SON international, which is BioSand Filter (BSF) producer in Tanzania. AQUA-BRIDGE and SON international will continue the collaboration.
